<p>Our address is 18750 I-45 #600, Spring, TX 77373.</p>
<p>This is a cooking and dining experience. You will enjoy the fruits of your labor and eat the meal / dishes you make. Classes start promptly and last 2.5 to 3 hours. Please be there 15-20 minutes early, where you can stop by the front desk to check in electronically.</p>
<p>In this hands-on class, you will work directly with raw product to create your own meal, cooking in teams of 2 to 4 students in our kitchens, or outdoor cooking on The Big Green Eggâ„¢. Please dress comfortably and wear non-slip shoes. Aprons and hats will be provided for you. Our goal is for you to leave the class having had a great experience, a sense of accomplishment and equipped with recipes for recreating the menu at home.</p>
<p>Non-alcoholic beverages are included in the price of the class. If you did not upgrade your experience by adding beer or wine during registration, in-class purchases will be available during the class. While you may not bring any outside alcoholic beverage, you may purchase from us before the class begins.</p>
